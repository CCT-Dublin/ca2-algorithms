 * Enum representing all available menu options in the Sugar Blossom
 * Department Store application.
 *
 * Each value corresponds to a specific feature that can be selected
 * by the user through the console-based menu. Using an enum ensures
 * consistency, avoids hard-coded strings, and supports a clear,
 * structured control flow in the application.
 *
 * The options include sorting applicant data, searching employees,
 * adding records, generating binary trees, and exiting the system.
